# Understand permissions & Access

## Request
	
How is permission granted to delete a file? Create a file that your
colleague can edit but not delete and another he can delete but not edit. Does it make sense to be able to assign such rights? What are the practical consequences of this experience?

## Answer

The key information is that the permission to delete a file is controlled by the **write permission on the parent directory**.

#### Practical examples

```bash
mkdir test_folder
cd test_folder

# Scenario 1: Colleague can edit but not delete
touch file1
chmod 664 file1          # rw-rw-r-- (colleague can edit)
chmod 555 .              # r-xr-xr-x (no directory write permission = cannot delete)

# Scenario 2: Colleague can delete but not edit
touch file2
chmod 444 file2          # r--r--r-- (colleague cannot edit)
chmod 775 .              # rwxrwxr-x (directory write permission = can delete)
```

**The execute (x) permission on a directory** means ability to traverse or access the directory

#### Use cases

1. In collaborative environments where different team members have different responsibilities.

2. In context of logs, administrators might need to delete old logs without being able to alter their content.

#### Practical consequences

1. Understanding the diffrence between deletion and modification rights is crucial for proper security setup.

2. It's important to understand directory permissions in addition to file permissions.
